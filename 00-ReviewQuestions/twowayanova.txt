(c) A chemist is testing the effect of two catalysts in an industrial process. The following
model was fitted:
yi ? a?bxi ?czi ?ei

where xi represents the amount of catalyst 1 during experiment i, zi represents the amount
of catalyst 2 during experiment i, yi represents the output of experiment i and ei
is the
error which is normally distributed with mean 0 and an unknown constant variance.
Everything is measured in grams. The estimated values were 12.46 for a, 25.18 for b
and 38.71 for c. Interpret the results in terms of the expected output of the experiment.

%% Question 3
An experiment is conducted to study how long different digital camera batteries last. The
aim is to find out whether there is a difference in terms of battery life between four brands
of batteries using seven different cameras. Each battery was tried once with each camera.
The time the Brand A battery lasted was 43.86 hours. The times for brands B, C and D were
41.28, 40.86 and 40 hours respectively. The following is the calculated ANOVA table with
some entries missing.
