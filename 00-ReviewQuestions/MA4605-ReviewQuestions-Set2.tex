\subsection*{Question 32 - Method Comparison}

An ion-selective electrode (ISE) determination of sulphide from sulphate-reducing bacteria was compared with a gravimetric determination. Each pair of determinations were taken from the same sample. \\ \\The results obtained by both methods are expressed in milligrams of sulphide, and are tabulated below.
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{|c|cccccccccc|}
		\hline
		% after \\: \hline or \cline{col1-col2} \cline{col3-col4} ...
		ISE method & 108 & 12& 152 & 3 & 106 & 11 &  128 & 12& 160& 128 \\
		gravimetry & 105 & 16& 113 & 1 & 108 &  11 & 141 & 161 & 182& 118\\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Two simple linear models are fitted to the data. Model C uses the gravimetric determination as an independent variable used to predict the ISE determination. Conversely, Model D uses the ISE determination as an independent variable used to predict the gravimetric determination. The relevant \texttt{R} output is presented on the following page.

\subsection*{Question 34 - Experimental Design}
\textit{(Remark : This question will not feature in the 2015 Winter Exam)}
\begin{itemize}
	\item[(i)] Give the principal features of a  balanced completely randomised design, and
	explain the role of replication in such a design.  \item[(ii)] State the statistical model for
	this design, define the terms in the model and state the standard assumptions
	made about the error term.
\item[(iii)] Two basic principles of experimental design are \textbf{randomisation} and
\textbf{replication}. Explain why these are important and how they help to
validate an analysis of experimental results. 
	\item[(iv)] Briefly explain the principles of randomisation and replication, in the
	context of a completely randomised experimental design. Write down the model equation for a completely randomised design
	having equal numbers of replicates in all treatment groups, defining all
	the symbols that you use.

\subsection*{Question 36-  Experimental Design Part 2 }

	In an investigation into the extraction of nitrate-nitrogen from air dried soil, three quantitative variables were investigated at two levels. These were the amount of oxidised activated charcoal (A) added to the extracting solution to remove organic interferences, the strength of CaSO4 extracting solution (C), and the time the soil was shaken with the solution (T). The aim of the investigation was to optimise the extraction procedure. The levels of the variables are given here:
	\begin{center}
		{

				Time (minutes) 	&	T 	&	30	&	60	\\ \hline
			\end{tabular} 
		}
	\end{center}
	
	The concentrations of nitrate-nitrogen were determined by ultra-violet spectrophotometry and compared with concentrations determined by a standard technique. The results are given below and are the amounts recovered (expressed as the percentage of known nitrate concentration).

\subsection*{Question 44}
An experiment is run on an operating chemical process in which the aim is to reduce the
amount of impurity produced. Three continuous variables are thought to affect impurity,
these are concentration of NaOH, agitation speed and temperature. As an initial investigation two settings are selected for each variable these are

\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
		\hline
		% after \\: \hline or \cline{col1-col2} \cline{col3-col4} ...
		Factor: &low level & highlevel  \\ \hline
		Concentration of NaOH & $40\%$ & $45\%$\\
		Agitation speed (rpm) & 15 & 25 \\
		Temperature ($^{\circ}{\rm F}$) & 170 & 200 \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Readings were recorded of the impurity produced from the chemical process for each combination of the levels of these factors, and each combination was tested twice.

\subsection*{Question 45}
Answer the following questions.

\begin{itemize}
	\item[i.] (1 marks) What is the purpose of maintaining control charts?
	\item[ii.] (1 marks) What is the \emph{Three Sigma} rule in the context of statistical process control?
	\item[iii.] (4 marks) Other than applying the \emph{Three Sigma} rule for detecting the presence of an assignable cause, what else do we look for when studying a control chart? Limit your answer to three examples. Support your answer with sketches.
	\item[iv.] (2 Marks) What is a CUSUM chart? What type of departures from the production target value
	is this type of chart useful for detecting?
