\frametitle{Wilxcon Signed Rank Test}

\begin{itemize}
\item This is a non-parametrix alternative to the paired student t-test for the case of two 
related samples or repeated measurements
\item 
The test requires that the data is measured at the interval level of measurement.
\item 
However it does not require assumptions about the form of the distributions about that measurement.

\subsection*{Mann Whitney U test}

Non parametric test to see if two samples came from the same distribution.
The null hypothesis is that both samples are from the same distribution, and therefore their probability distributions are equal
