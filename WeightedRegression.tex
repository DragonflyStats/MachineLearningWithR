\section{Regression}
Unweighted regression requires that the variability of the
residuals is constant over the measured range of values.
(This is called homoskedasticity).

Weighted regression does not have this requirement.
There may be differing variability over the range of values.
(This is called heteroskedasticity).

Weighted regression requires extra information on the standard deviations of the responses so as to compute the weights.

Unweighted regression doesnâ€™t need or use any information on the response standard deviations.

Weighted regression is preferable if heteroskedasticity evident in the data

(If there is not constant variance for the residuals over the range of values)
