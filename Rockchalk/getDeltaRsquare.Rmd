getDeltaRsquare Calculates the delta R-squares, also known as squared semi-partial
correlation coefficients.

#### Description

The change in the R-square when a variable is removed from a regression is called delta R-square.
It is sometimes suggested as a way to determine whether a variable has a substantial effect on an
outcome. This is also known as the squared semi-partial correlation coefficient.

#### Usage

getDeltaRsquare(model)
Arguments
model a fitted regression model
Value
a vector of estimates of the delta R-squares

#### Examples

dat1 <- genCorrelatedData(N=250, means=c(100,100),
sds=c(30,20), rho=0.0, stde = 7, beta=c(1.1, 2.4, 4.1, 0))
m1 <- lm(y ~ x1 + x2, data=dat1)
getDeltaRsquare(m1)
## more problematic in presence of collinearity
dat2 <- genCorrelatedData(N=250, means=c(100,100),
sds=c(30,20), rho=0.6, stde = 7, beta=c(1.1, 2.4, 4.1, 0))
m2 <- lm(y ~ x1 + x2, data=dat2)
getDeltaRsquare(m2)
