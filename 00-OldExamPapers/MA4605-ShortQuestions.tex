An ion-selective electrode (ISE) determination of sulphide from sulphate-reducing bacteria was compared with a gravimetric determination. Each pair of determinations were taken from the same sample. \\ \\The results obtained by both methods are expressed in milligrams of sulphide, and are tabulated below.
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{|c|cccccccccc|}

		% after \\: \hline or \cline{col1-col2} \cline{col3-col4} ...

\subsection*{Question 36-  Experimental Design Part 2 }

In an investigation into the extraction of nitrate-nitrogen from air dried soil, three quantitative variables were investigated at two levels. These were the amount of oxidised activated charcoal (A) added to the extracting solution to remove organic interferences, the strength of CaSO4 extracting solution (C), and the time the soil was shaken with the solution (T). The aim of the investigation was to optimise the extraction procedure. The levels of the variables are given here:
\begin{center}

			Time (minutes) 	&	T 	&	30	&	60	\\ \hline
		\end{tabular}

The concentrations of nitrate-nitrogen were determined by ultra-violet spectrophotometry and compared with concentrations determined by a standard technique. The results are given below and are the amounts recovered (expressed as the percentage of known nitrate concentration).

\subsection*{Question 44 - Factorial Design}
An experiment is run on an operating chemical process in which the aim is to reduce the
amount of impurity produced. Three continuous variables are thought to affect impurity,
these are concentration of NaOH, agitation speed and temperature. As an initial investigation two settings are selected for each variable these are

\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
		\hline
		% after \\: \hline or \cline{col1-col2} \cline{col3-col4} ...
		Factor: &low level & highlevel  \\ \hline
		Concentration of NaOH & $40\%$ & $45\%$\\
		Agitation speed (rpm) & 15 & 25 \\
		Temperature ($^{\circ}{\rm F}$) & 170 & 200 \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Readings were recorded of the impurity produced from the chemical process for each combination of the levels of these factors, and each combination was tested twice.

\subsection*{Question 47 - Nelson Rules for Control Charts}
The \textbf{Nelson Rules} are a set of eight decision rules for detecting ``out-of-control" or non-random conditions on control charts. These rules are applied to a control chart on which the magnitude of some variable is plotted against time. The rules are based on the mean value and the standard deviation of the samples.\\

\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)] ($4 \times 2$ Marks) Discuss any four of these rules, and how they would be used to detect ``out of control" processes. Support your answer with sketch.

\noindent \textit{In your answer, you may make reference to the following properties of the Normal Distribution. Consider the random variable $X$ distributed as
\[X \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu,\sigma^2)\]
where $\mu$ is the mean and $\sigma^2$ is the variance of an random variable $X$.}
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\Pr( \mu - 1\sigma \leq X \leq \mu + 1\sigma ) = 0.6827$
	\item $\Pr( \mu - 2\sigma \leq X \leq \mu + 2\sigma ) = 0.9545$
