	In ordinary linear regression, the goal is to minimize the sum of
		the squared vertical distances between the y data values and the
		corresponding y values on the fitted line. In orthogonal
		regression the goal is to minimize the orthogonal (perpendicular)
		distances from the data points to the fitted line.

		} \]
